/**
 * Added Next Block - This will cause issue on the last block synced 
 * since it does not have next block value yet in order to fix it we have to make sure we update that
 * block on scan
 * 
 * acc_checkpoint:
 * Unlike most other cryptocurrencies that currently utilize a zerocoin-based protocol, 
 * PIVX zPIV utilizes a very efficient accumulator checkpointing system which allows the 
 * zPiv spend process to utilize checkpoints that contains all mints that were made prior to 
 * the zPiv mint being spent, as well as  a user selected amount of zPiv mints beyond the checkpoint.
 * This allows for a large pool of coins in the accumulator while still having much smaller computation 
 * requirements. PIVXâ€™s zPiv implementation yields minimal resource consumption and makes zPIV 
 * transactions one of the fastest private transfers in the market today.
 * 
 * moneysupply:
 * The Value moneysupply has been added in the PIVX Wallets 
 * This keeps track of the curent supply on the chain at the current block Heigth
 * 
 * chainwork:
 * The chainwork value is really just the total amount of work in the chain.
 * It is the total number of hashes that are expected to have been necessary to produce the current chain, 
 * in hexadecimal. The chainwork is used to identify the correct chain, the biggest chainwork value means 
 * the strongest or the correct chain.
 * 
 * type:
 * Will Reflect the Generating of Block eg POS / POW / POB
 * POS - Proof of Stake
 * POW - Proof of Work
 * POB - Proof of Burn
